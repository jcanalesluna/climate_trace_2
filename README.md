# Climate TRACE Data: the Quest for a Sincere and Effective Climate Narrative

In September 2021, Climate TRACE, a coalition of climate-focused NGOs, technology companies, and universities, supported by former Vice President Al Gore, released the first Comprehensive, independent database of global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissinos. THe coalition levarages the power cutting-edge technologies such as satellites, remote sensing, and advanced applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, to identify and track human-caused GHG emissions with unprecedented detail and speed.

In September 2022, Climate TRACE published a new release with emission data from 2021, along with new datasets with asset information. 

The purpose of this project is analysing the emissions inventory, using Python and Jupyter Notebook. I have also used other sources, such as population and GDP data from the World Bank, as well as the data from the Global Climate Risk IndexC. You can find all the datasets in the folder "datasets".

Some of the analysis have been published in well-estabished platforms, such as Towards Data Science. Below you can find the publications:
